# thbot-README
hello
You may use thbot as a reference for discord.java stuff, just don't plagarize mine, or others code unless stated otherwise. The `thbot.py` will stay up because there is <i>no</i> discord bots i can find made with python, so feel free to use that as a little crappy reference. Thbot.java is where i will now work. <3

<strong>thbot.java is where the main stuff is. i may make experimental files, but thbot.java is where the main commands are.</strong>
