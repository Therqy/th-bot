# thbot-bot-README
hello
you can use thbot as a reference for discord.java stuff, just don't plagarize mine, or others code unless stated otherwise. the thbot.py will stay up because there is <i>no</i> discord bits i can find made with python, but thbot.java is where i will now work. <3

<strong>thbot.py is where the main stuff is. i may make experimental files, but thbot.py is where the main commands are.</strong>
